##stdio is an experiment
<p>
We wanted to create a sustainable platform for text content. So we tried two things: we made our content creators our owners and we told them: if they wanted to keep it, they just had to sustain it.
</p>
<p>
The idea is very simple: the users own stdio and the sustenance of the website falls on those who find value in it. The owners (read: users) control the bearing of the ship with a quarterly vote. Ownership and elections are secured by the Bitcoin Blockchain using the Counterparty Protocol.
</p>
##how does it work?
<p>
Sign up <a href="http://stdio.io/#!/signup">here</a> and see for yourself.
</p>
<p>
Content is text. Post any text you want. As other users comment on and "upvote" (thanks reddit) your content, you get *kismet*. KSMT is a secure token, a title to ownership of stdio and a vote in every quarterly election. As an owner of KSMT you now hold the fate of stdio in your hands- treat your new property with care.
</p>
<p>
As a holder of kismet and stdio owner, you now have access to the stdio boardroom. Here you can see the operating budget, a breakdown of the other owners, the treasury, and the scheduled shareholder voting sessions. This is how every user can influence the site's policies and operating procedures.
</p>
##why the experiment?
<p>
The internet is in the midst of a consumer identity crisis: the consumer has yet to figure out a smooth way to pay for content. stdio presents a clean platform, free from advertising and wall-street money. Create anything, no outside pressure.
</p>
<p>
We think our experiment has the chance to succeed where others have failed due to recent leaps in digital economics. Micro-transactions make crowdfunding more efficient while blockchain-based digital ownership brings a flood of new management possibilities. All the while, rapid investment in cloud computing means every day, server space is the cheapest it has ever been.
</p>
<p>
Vast communities of users can run a platform for pennies per year. That price is the highest it will ever be <i>today</i>. Even better, users can influence the platform's course through cryptographically-secured elections, backed by the largest computational force on Earth: the Bitcoin blockchain.
</p>
##why Bitcoin?
<p>
Bitcoin is the next generation financial tool that makes stdio work. Our financial transparency is made possible by Bitcoin's open ledger, while our crowd-sourced revenue model relies on digital money's micro-transact-ability. Our mass ownership title system and shareholder voting system run on Counterparty's Bitcoin 2.0 technology.
</p>
##its all yours
<p>
Now go- create, consume. Be an artist and a journalist and a reader. Share everything you want with whoever you want. But remember: stdio is yours. Raise it with care and sustain it as long as it brings you value. But don't forget, it's just a website. One day, when it becomes too... much: let it die.
